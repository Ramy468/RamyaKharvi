    <p>Technical documentation is any document that explains the features of the respective product. In this project,
        we are going to create a technical documentation of C++ using HTML and CSS. The webpage has a menu sections 
        that helps to navigate to different sections of the webpage.</p>
       <p>
       We are going to divide the whole webpage into two sections. The left side has a menu called Documentation Menu
        with all the topics listed inside a navigation bar. It contains anchor tags which has links to IDs of all the
         sections(like inheritance, polymorphism etc.). In the right side, we have description for each of the topics. 
         The idea behind this is once user clicks on one of the topics in the left section, respective topic details
          will load the content on the right. In the CSS file we are just beautifying the texts like its alignment,
           padding margin etc.</p>

    <div id="div2"><h2>What is Java programming language used for?&nbsp;</h2> 
        <p>Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localized and distributed software. Some common uses of Java include:</p> 
        <h3>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Game Development</h3> 
        <p>Many popular mobile, computer, and video games are built in Java. Even modern games that integrate advanced technology like machine learning or virtual reality are built with Java technology.</p> 
        <h3>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Cloud computing</h3> 
        <p>Java is often referred to as WORA â€“ Write Once and Run Anywhere, making it perfect for decentralized cloud-based applications. Cloud providers choose Java language to run programs on a wide range of underlying platforms.</p> 
        <h3>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Big Data</h3> 
        <p>Java is used for data processing engines that can work with complex data sets and massive amounts of real-time data.</p> 
        <h3>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial Intelligence</h3> 
        <p>Java is a powerhouse of machine learning libraries. Its stability and speed make it perfect for artificial intelligence application development like natural language processing and deep learning.</p> 
        <h3>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Internet of Things</h3> 
        <p>Java has been used to program sensors and hardware in edge devices that can connect independently to the internet.</p> </div>
